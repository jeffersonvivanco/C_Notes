# C_Notes

These are my notes on C. My notes compose of short C programs that explain
the concepts of C. Please use a linux distro to run these short programs. 
(I recommend Kali Linux.)

Use the -g option when compiling to be able to debug it later using gdb.
If you don't have gdb, install by running -> apt install gdb.

##gdb notes
Run it with -q to supress the welcome banner.
Commands:
